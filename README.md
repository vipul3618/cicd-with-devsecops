#  Integrating Docker, Kubernetes, and DevSecOps into a CI/CD Pipeline using GitHub Actions

## Overview
This repository showcases a **fully automated CI/CD pipeline** built with **GitHub Actions**, combining the power of **Docker**, **Kubernetes**, and **DevSecOps** practices for secure and efficient application delivery.

The workflow covers the entire lifecycle — from **code commit** to **secure deployment** — by automating testing, vulnerability scanning, image building, and Kubernetes releases via **Helm**. Using **ArgoCD**, the pipeline follows **GitOps principles** to keep the live environment perfectly aligned with the repository.

---

##  Key Highlights
- **Automated Continuous Integration**
  - Runs on every push or pull request.
  - Builds Docker images and runs tests automatically.
- **Security at Every Stage (DevSecOps)**
  - Vulnerability scanning with **Trivy**.
  - Static analysis and code quality checks with **SonarQube**.
- **Continuous Deployment**
  - Automated deployment to Kubernetes clusters using **Helm**.
  - Updated images pushed to the registry are deployed instantly.
- **Infrastructure as Code**
  - Consistent and repeatable deployments with Helm charts.
- **Version Control**
  - Automated tagging and semantic versioning for builds.
- **GitOps Ready**
  - Declarative deployments managed by **ArgoCD**.

---

##  Requirements
Before running the pipeline, ensure you have:

- **GitHub account** with a repository.
- **Docker** installed locally.
- A working **Kubernetes cluster** (Minikube, AKS, EKS, GKE, etc.).
- **Helm** for Kubernetes package management.
- **ArgoCD** installed and connected to your cluster.
- GitHub Secrets configured:
  - `DOCKER_USERNAME` / `DOCKER_PASSWORD` — Registry credentials.
  - `KUBECONFIG` — Kubernetes config (Base64 encoded if needed).
  - `REGISTRY_URL` — Container registry endpoint.
  - `HELM_CHART_PATH` — Path to the Helm chart.

## ⚙ Workflow Breakdown

### **1️. Continuous Integration**
**Trigger:** On push or PR.  
**Process:**
1. Pull repository code.
2. Run lint checks and unit tests.
3. Build Docker image.
4. Perform vulnerability scanning (Trivy) and static code analysis (SonarQube).
5. Push image to the registry.

### **2️. Continuous Deployment**
**Trigger:** Successful build on the `main` branch.  
**Process:**
1. Retrieve and update Helm chart values.
2. Deploy updated application to Kubernetes.
3. Sync live state via ArgoCD.
4. Validate deployment health.

---

##  Usage Instructions
1. Fork and clone this repository.
2. Add required GitHub Secrets.
3. Push changes to the `main` branch.
4. Monitor build and deployment progress in **GitHub Actions**.
5. Check application status on Kubernetes.
6. Verify sync status in the **ArgoCD dashboard**.

---

##  Why This Setup?
- **Security-first pipeline** with built-in DevSecOps practices.
- **Faster delivery** through automation.
- **Scalable deployments** using Kubernetes.
- **Consistent releases** using GitOps.

##  Conclusion
This CI/CD pipeline automates the **entire software development lifecycle**, from code commit to production deployment.  
By integrating **DevSecOps**, **Docker**, and **Kubernetes** with **GitOps principles**, it ensures:
- Secure deployments
- Rapid delivery cycles
- Scalability and reliability
